# Getting Started with Udacity React app

In this project, we have a bookshelf app that allows to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application

This project was provided by [Udacity](https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd019).

Supported by [React 18](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) version 18.2.0.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on.\
If the package has a package-lock, or an npm shrinkwrap file, or a yarn lock file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
